                    </h3>

                <div class="exp-descr">
                    Rescue services increasingly exploit autonomous systems as a support tool during mass emergencies. 
                    For example, fleets of <b>drones</b> can be deployed to monitor an enclosed area and interact with human 
                    subjects to foster cooperation and ease the evacuation process.
                    As a highly safety-critical setting, ensuring the drones' <b>decision-making</b> policies guarantee certain 
                    properties is fundamental to maximizing life-savings. To this end, the <a href="https://www.open.ac.uk/">Open University</a>
                    and Politecnico di Milano are developing a formal game-theoretic approach to synthesizing strategies 
                    for drones deployed on the scene.<br>

                    This thesis aims to explore how <b>learning models</b> of human behavior at real-time (i.e., 
                    during the emergency) and incorporating them into the formal approach improves the efficiency of drones'
                    decisions. To this end <b>automata learning</b> algorithms will be employed. The developed approach will be tested
                    in simulation.

                    <b>Digital Twin</b> (DT) development is a potentially disruptive technology to the manufacturing field,
                    allowing for an efficient and powerful real-time analysis of complex real-life systems. 
                    However, creating and maintaining DTs requires huge manual effort. Therefore, the

                    process mining are employed to learn mathematical models of the system under analysis from field-collected data. 
                    This project aims to extend the employed model learning techniques to learn decision policies. The developed methodology

                    Politecnico di Milano is developing an <b>automata Learning</b> algorithm that, fed with traces recording the behavior 
                    of a Cyber-Physical System, mines a Stochastic Hybrid Automaton modeling the system under learning (SUL). 
                    Given its <b>data-driven</b> nature, the resulting model only captures a subset of the possible SUL behaviors. 
                    In reality, numerous variations of training traces may occur that are not captured by the learned model. 
                    However, repeating the learning with a more extensive training dataset may demand significant time and resources.<br>
                    Possible trace variations have been classified (e.g., the repetition of a known event or the occurrence of 
                    two known events in a different order). This thesis aims to develop <b>automated corrections</b> to the 
                    learned model to make it robust to trace variations without repeating the learning. The envisaged repair 
                    solutions shall be implemented and tested on toy use cases and real-life systems to assess the added value of a
                    more extensive model and the loss of accuracy compared to re-training.<br><br>

                <div class="exp-descr">
                    Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in our everyday lives as general-purpose
                    assistants, raising a concern for potentially <b>unethical</b> responses or suggestions.
                    In this perspective, developing <b>automated testing</b> approaches to assess an LLM's proneness to unethicality 
                    is an open challenge. Given the fundamental differences between generative AI and traditional software systems, 
                    foundational testing principles must be revised to incorporate the concepts of input, fault, failure, and oracle. 
                    Furthermore, developing automated oracles in situations where evaluation requires human judgment 
                    (e.g., distinguishing between ethical and unethical content) is particularly challenging.<br> 
                    The goal of this project is to develop an automated testing <b>pipeline</b> for a target LLM, designed to 
                    be agnostic with respect to the specific models and oracles employed.<br><br>

                    </h3>

                    Polimi has developed a framework for the development of robotic applications in service settings (e.g., hospitals, home assistance, education). 
                    The framework includes a design-time analysis phase that supports the specification of human-machine teaming missions. 
                    Given the specification, requirements for the mission can be proven (e.g., probability of success greater than 0.9,
                    maximum fatigue of human agents less than 0.5). <br>
                    However, a number of factors can <b>dynamically change</b> and affect the satisfaction of such 
                    requirements. These factors include quantities observable from the external environment as well as configuration parameters of the system 
                    that may be controlled at <b>runtime</b>. <br>
                    This thesis project aims at making robotic applications <b>self-adaptive</b>, that is, able to adjust its 
                    controllable parameters automatically at runtime with the goal of maximizing the likelihood of satisfying all the requirements. 
                    Self-adaptation shall be proactive, meaning that the system shall be able to forecast possible violations and adapt itself to avoid them. 
                    The selected adaptation measure shall be subject to <b>verification</b> to assess its soundness, ensuring the verification result is 
                    available within the estimated remaining duration of the mission.<br>
                    The thesis shall result in a software tool that support the proactive self-adaptation as well as an empirical evaluation of feasibility, 
                    and cost-effectiveness using one or more case studies.<br><br>

                    <b>Active automata learning</b> is a long-standing research area targeting the synthesis of minimal Deterministic Finite-state Automata (DFA). 
                    Foundational learning algorithms (e.g., L*) and tools (e.g., the LearnLib library) can be found in the literature.<br>
                    Well-established techniques rely on the assumption that an <b>omniscient oracle</b> of the System Under Learning (SUL) is available. 
                    However, as complex <b>Cyber-Physical systems</b> grow increasingly widespread, it is paramount to challenge the assumption that perfect knowledge 
                    about the SUL is feasible in practice. Indeed, novel data-driven automata learning techniques targeting Hybrid Automata or Markov Decision 
                    Processes have been recently introduced.<br>
                    With this thesis proposal, we foster the investigation of the following research issues:
                    <ul>
                    <li> How do well-established automata learning algorithms (e.g., L*) perform in a realistic scenario, thus with a non-omniscient oracle 
                    relying on partial observations of the SUL?
                    <li> How can these algorithms be modified/extended to work in a more realistic setup?
                    <li> To this end, can an AI-based oracle (e.g., a Neural Network) be exploited?
                    <li> Could this setup simultaneously serve the purpose of generating an <b>explainable</b> model of the AI-based oracle?
                    </ul>

                    (such as hospitals, home assistance, education) that can handle the unpredictability of
                    <b>human behavior</b>.
                    The framework includes a <b>design-time</b> analysis phase to estimate the most likely outcome of 
                    the mission (e.g., success vs. failure due to low battery charge) and, subsequently, deploy 
                    (or simulate) the application. Due to the uncertainties in the environment, the outcome observed 
                    at runtime may not match the one estimated offline, thus, requiring a <b>reconfiguration</b> of the mission 
                    before running new simulations.<br>
                    The reconfiguration is currently performed <b>manually</b> by the framework's user. This thesis project 
                    aims to automate the reconfiguration (or "<b>re-planning</b>") phase by developing a tool to compute 
                    alternative plans for the user to choose from and automatically repeat the design-time verification.<br>
                    The thesis outcome should include a solid <b>justification</b> for the chosen re-planning strategy and 
                    <b>validation</b> on significant use cases, highlighting the re-planning phase's added value.<br><br>

                    Pursue is a development framework for service robotic applications in which robotic agents interact with humans and both collaborate 
                    to achieve common goals, such as ''<i>the robot should carry an item without bumping into the humans moving in the ward</i>''.
                    Pursue applications can be designed effectively using <b>Timed Games</b> and controlled at runtime through game strategies that govern the 
                    collaborative actions of the agents.<BR>
                    The development of Pursue applications follows a two-steps approach whereby the application is first specified by a <b>domain specific 
                    language</b> (Pursue-ML) and analyzed for feasibility; and secondly the application is automatically deployed in a realistic scenario 
                    (the target robotic platform is TurtleBot).<br>
                    If the first phase is successful, the <b>application controller</b>, which allows the application to fulfil the desired goal, is created. 
                    The deployment phase is realized by automatically translating the controller into executable ROS code and by setting up the ROS nodes 
                    that manage the application at runtime.<br>
                    Possible thesis are related to the following activities:
                    <ul>
                        <li> improving Pursue-ML to capture more complex forms of collaborations and scenarios;
                        <li> improving the translation of game strategies into executable ROS code;
                        <li> improving the automatic deployment to create digital-twin based applications in which physical agents operate in the real environment 
                        while virtual ones operate in the CoppeliaSIM virtual scene.<br><br>
                    </ul>
