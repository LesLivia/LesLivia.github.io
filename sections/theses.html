                    </h3>

                    Polimi has developed a framework for the development of robotic applications in service settings (e.g., hospitals, home assistance, education). 
                    The framework includes a design-time analysis phase that supports the specification of human-machine teaming missions. 
                    Given the specification, requirements for the mission can be proven (e.g., probability of succes grater than 0.9,
                    maximum fatigue of human agents less than 0.5). <br>
                    However, a number of factors can <b>dynamically change</b> and affect the satisfaction of such 
                    requirements. These factors include quantities observable from the external environment as well as configuration parameters of the system 
                    that may be controlled at <b>runtime</b>. <br>
                    This thesis project aims at making robotic applications <b>self-adaptive</b>, that is, able to adjust its 
                    controllable parameters automatically at runtime with the goal of maximizing the likelihood of satisfying all the requirements. 
                    Self-adaptation shall be proactive, meaning that the system shall be able to forecast possible violations and adapt itself to avoid them. 
                    The thesis shall result in a software tool that support the proactive self-adaptation as well as an empirical evaluation of feasibility, 
                    and cost-effectiveness using one or more case studies.<br><br>

                    </h3>

                <div class="exp-descr">
                    <b>Active automata learning</b> is a long-standing research area targeting the synthesis of minimal Deterministic Finite-state Automata (DFA). 
                    Foundational learning algorithms (e.g., L*) and tools (e.g., the LearnLib library) can be found in the literature.<br>
                    Well-established techniques rely on the assumption that an <b>omniscient oracle</b> of the System Under Learning (SUL) is available. 
                    However, as complex <b>Cyber-Physical systems</b> grow increasingly widespread, it is paramount to challenge the assumption that perfect knowledge 
                    about the SUL is feasible in practice. Indeed, novel data-driven automata learning techniques targeting Hybrid Automata or Markov Decision 
                    Processes have been recently introduced.<br>
                    With this thesis proposal, we foster the investigation of the following research issues:
                    <ul>
                    <li> How do well-established automata learning algorithms (e.g., L*) perform in a realistic scenario, thus with a non-omniscient oracle 
                    relying on partial observations of the SUL?
                    <li> How can these algorithms be modified/extended to work in a more realistic setup?
                    <li> To this end, can an AI-based oracle (e.g., a Neural Network) be exploited?
                    <li> Could this setup simultaneously serve the purpose of generating an <b>explainable</b> model of the AI-based oracle?
                    </ul>

                    Polimi has developed a framework for developing robotic applications in <b>service settings</b>
                    (such as hospitals, home assistance, education) that can handle the unpredictability of
                    <b>human behavior</b>.<br>
                    Analysis at design time (i.e., before the interactive scenario is deployed or simulated) entails 
                    a manual scenario configuration. The application designer defines the geometrical layout where 
                    the humans and the robot operate, the robots' characteristics, the humans' characteristics, 
                    and how the humans and the robot will interact. The latter always conforms to pre-defined <b>interaction patterns</b>
                    such as "<i>Human Follower</i>" and "<i>Human Leader,</i>" capturing the human following or leading 
                    the robot to a specific destination.<br> 
                    This project aims at developing a user-friendly notation to define custom interaction patterns 
                    should the pre-determined set fail to capture the desired contingency. The candidate will: 
                    <ol>
                    <li> identify and abstract the characteristics that define an interaction pattern 
                        and distinguish it from others in the set;
                    <li> develop a notation (from scratch or extending a pre-existing one) to define 
                        such characteristics in an accessible fashion;
                    <li> validate the contribution through examples of human-robot interactions inspired by realistic scenarios.
                    </ol>

                    The framework includes a <b>design-time</b> analysis phase to estimate the most likely outcome of

                    The thesis outcome should include a solid <b>justification</b> for the chosen re-planning strategy and

                <div class="exp-descr">
                    Pursue is a development framework for service robotic applications in which robotic agents interact with humans and both collaborate 
                    to achieve common goals, such as ''<i>the robot should carry an item without bumping into the humans moving in the ward</i>''.
                    Pursue applications can be designed effectively using <b>Timed Games</b> and controlled at runtime through game strategies that govern the 
                    collaborative actions of the agents.<BR>
                    The development of Pursue applications follows a two-steps approach whereby the application is first specified by a <b>domain specific 
                    language</b> (Pursue-ML) and analyzed for feasibility; and secondly the application is automatically deployed in a realistic scenario 
                    (the target robotic platform is TurtleBot).<br>
                    If the first phase is successful, the <b>application controller</b>, which allows the application to fulfil the desired goal, is created. 
                    The deployment phase is realized by automatically translating the controller into executable ROS code and by setting up the ROS nodes 
                    that manage the application at runtime.<br>
                    Possible thesis are related to the following activities:
                    <ul>
                        <li> improving Pursue-ML to capture more complex forms of collaborations and scenarios;
                        <li> improving the translation of game strategies into executable ROS code;
                        <li> improving the automatic deployment to create digital-twin based applications in which physical agents operate in the real environment 
                        while virtual ones operate in the CoppeliaSIM virtual scene.<br><br>
                    </ul>
