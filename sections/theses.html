                    </h3>

                <div class="exp-descr">
                    Polimi has developed a data-driven <b>automata learning</b> algorithm targeting Stochastic Hybrid Automata, 
                    that is, models featuring both variables with non-trivial time dynamics and stochastic processes.
                    In a joint project with <a href="https://www.mecc.polimi.it/ricerca/sezioni/tecnologie-meccaniche-e-produzione/">DMec</a>, 
                    the algorithm has been successfully applied to learn a model of the <b>energy consumption</b> of a metalworking CNC machine.
                    The learned model can be exploited to estimate the energy required to perform a specific sequence of operations 
                    and plan the manufacturing task from a <b>sustainability</b> perspective.<br><br>
                    This proposal aims to expand the work in two directions (constituting two standalone thesis projects):<br><br>
                    <b>(a)</b> Previous applications of the learning algorithm assume that differential equations constraining relevant 
                    physical variables of the system are known <i>a priori</i>. On the other hand, power consumption exhibits complex time dynamics
                    whose exact <b>model</b> is <b>unknown</b>. The aim of the thesis is to find and implement the most suitable <b>signal processing 
                    technique</b> to identify an approximated power consumption model from available data. The work should be validated to assess 
                    the improvement in energy estimation accuracy compared to previous results.<br><br>
                    <b>(b)</b> The currently learned model does not capture the <b>probability</b> of observing a specific sequence of operations. 
                    Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to estimate such probabilities from available data and perform post-processing of
                    the learned model to reduce its size by <b>pruning</b> improbable event sequences. 
                    The refined model may then be put through <b>planning and/or optimization techniques</b> 
                    to identify the plan that achieves a specific goal by simultaneously <b>minimizing</b> energy consumption.<br>    
                    <br><br>

                <div class="exp-descr">
                    Polimi has developed a data-driven <b>automata learning</b> algorithm targeting Stochastic Hybrid Automata, 
                    that is, models featuring both variables with non-trivial time dynamics and stochastic processes.
                    The work addresses the issue of modeling complex <b>Cyber-Physical Systems</b> for analysis, monitoring, or software
                    development purposes when significant sources of uncertainty---such as human behavior---are at play.
                    The algorithm is agnostic to the specific system under learning and applicable to domains
                    ranging from interactive robotics to smart manufacturing systems.<br>
                    However, specifying the case study's features necessary to perform the learning is still time-consuming and cumbersome, 
                    even for users with good programming skills.
                    This thesis project aims to develop a <b>high-level</b> user-friendly <b>notation </b>to specify the necessary features
                    of the case study under analysis and a code generation procedure necessary to perform the learning in practice.
                    The result should be <b>validated</b> to assess its effectiveness and the advantage compared to manual specification.<br><br>

                    </h3>
                </div>
                <div class="exp-descr">
                    Polimi has developed a framework for developing robotic applications in <b>service settings</b>
                    (such as hospitals, home assistance, education) that can handle the unpredictability of
                    <b>human behavior</b>.
                    The framework includes a <b>design-time</b> analysis phase to estimate the most likely outcome of 
                    the mission (e.g., success vs. failure due to low battery charge) and, subsequently, deploy 
                    (or simulate) the application. Due to the uncertainties in the environment, the outcome observed 
                    at runtime may not match the one estimated offline, thus, requiring a <b>reconfiguration</b> of the mission 
                    before running new simulations.<br>
                    The reconfiguration is currently performed <b>manually</b> by the framework's user. This thesis project 
                    aims to automate the reconfiguration (or "<b>re-planning</b>") phase by developing a tool to compute 
                    alternative plans for the user to choose from and automatically repeat the design-time verification.<br>
                    The thesis outcome should include a solid <b>justification</b> for the chosen re-planning strategy and 
                    <b>validation</b> on significant use cases, highlighting the re-planning phase's added value.<br><br>
